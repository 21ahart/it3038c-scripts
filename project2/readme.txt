calculatorV2.py is a program built to compute up to three intager numbers instead of only two.

How use:
-Find the file path of this file and execute it within powershell by entering "py (file path)"
-You must format your expression with spaces between the operators and numbers
Example: "10 + -9" or "10 + 8 * 6"
-You must use integer values for this calcualtor. Double and float values will throw
errors.
-The program accepts any programming operator " +, -, *, /, %"
-The order of operations rules are in place so expressions *, /, % will compute first.
-The expected result should contain your original expression and what it equals to.
-You can keep on computing numbers until you type in "exit" at which point the program
will close.
